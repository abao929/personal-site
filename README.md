Hey, this is my portfolio site's repository. You can visit it [here](https://abao929.github.io).  
Make sure to check out the remake of it.

## [Posture Check](https://abao929.github.io/posture-check/)

A silly website I built in React with Typescript that alrets you about your posture. Hosted as well on this same site and the code is linked in a [separate repository](https://github.com/abao929/posture-check)

## [Playground](https://abao929.github.io/html/playground/)

Somewhere hidden in the recesses of the site is a ["playground"](https://abao929.github.io/html/playground/) of sorts. I didn't know what to name it, but it's essentially just smaller snippets of stuff that I wanted to learn/mess around with. I'll get around to styling this page one day.

### Case Study: [Forms](https://abao929.github.io/html/playground/forms/forms.html)

[Page 1](https://abao929.github.io/html/playground/forms/forms.html#_1)  
Inspiration - [Behance Design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/139962237/Industrial-Design-Portfolio-2022)  
Colors - #f0f0e8, #675c3e, #bbb6b3, #000, #d8d8d0  
Fonts - Default serif and sans serif fonts  
Hours Spent - 7?  
Rating - 8/10  
Takeaways - Should've spent some time in Figma laying this out and planning the HTML layout better.
Unsure of how to make these shapes responsive.
Responsive layout is doomed, maybe pt. 2 is just going back
and refactoring all this code so it's responsive.

[Page 2](https://abao929.github.io/html/playground/forms/forms.html#_2)  
Inspiration - [Chobani](https://www.chobani.com/)  
Colors - #193c34, #f4f3ef, and tints of each  
Fonts - Cooper Black, Magnolia  
Hours Spent - 6  
Rating - 9/10  
Takeaways - Again should've spent some time in Figma first, though the layout was p simple. However, since I came up w the design, it was a bit harder than copying.
This form looks so much better than the previous one, though the previous patterns were cooler. Color and font goes a loooong way. Typography is sick and I want to make my own font. Pls let me into a RISD course.

[Page 3](https://abao929.github.io/html/playground/forms/forms.html#_3)  
Inspiration - [Tapestry](https://www.tapestry.com/)  
Colors - #ffcd00, #000, #fff3c0 - black and yellow  
Fonts - Playfair Display  
Hours Spent - 6  
Rating - 6/10  
Takeaways - OK THIS ONE'S GONNA HAVE A FIGMA, SASS, AND RESPONSIVE - HALF WEEK PROJECT!!! So I kinda lied. Only have a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/7cmxxP2rDHfeB6BYVRFCg5/Form-3?node-id=0%3A1). Making this responsive seems too hard because of the SVG sizing. I don't think there really was a need for SASS for this section though this project as a whole should have been done in SASS since it has the nested selectors which would make this a lot cleaner than having to select using #\_x for each page. Overall, this design just looks kinda chunky and not as clean as the Figma.

[Page 4](https://abao929.github.io/html/playground/forms/forms.html#_4)  
Inspiration - [A24](https://www.a24films.com/)  
Color - B&W  
Fonts - Domaine Display Narrow, Helvetica Neue  
Hours Spent - 6 - 4 Figma, 2 coding  
Rating - 9/10  
Goals - Try layout that's not 50/50 and new type of input/label styling  
Takeaways - Felt like this went pretty well, definitely could make this responsive, but still a bit scuffed with the SVG placement/styling. SVG also has lots of lines so it makes rendering suuuper slow. Not super satisfied with the typography, especially the navbar. Quite liking the hover effects for the bottom half - should abstract it with some variables
