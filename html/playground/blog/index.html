          I originally started this on Sunday??? but have not touched it until
          today. Not sure if I will be doing this as a daily thing because it is
          kinda time consuming with all the styling and whatnot. Perhaps I can
          automate this in the future where I just submit a title and text and
          then the date related stuff gets autofilled in and then I just have an
          api that gets a random color scheme for a given date and then it
          creates the template. <br />
          In terms of the actual blog, I've been slacking this week and have not
          been working much, mostly just going out to eat and watching anime.
          Much needed break after grinding in the summer, but I guess it has
          been necessary because I need to prep for interviews for next summer.
          Google lifestyle looks so comfortable so I definitely will be sweating
          my ass off to make it. <br />
          Lol this page looks so mid - 6/10

            Celtics won game 3 last night which got me feeling some kind of way.
            I ended up watching the rest of love is war s2 last night. Outside
            of those 2 things I have not done shit since then. Probably just
            doing the crossword and maybe go out later? <br /><br />
            Ended up going out for ramen with Raph and Toshi which was sooooo
            good. Chilled in the park after and lost infinite money on boba
            bets. Also binge watched like half of s3 and ruined my sleep.
            <br /><br />
            Onto Gov Ball tmrw which should be fun. Probably will just use day 1
            template instead since I don't fully understand the box shadowing
            for this page. Credit goes to Lynn Fisher on codepen. Can't link it
            here because of z-index issues so just look it up ig. I should try
            and make this entire site a book to imitate a real journal but that
            would require a lot of js that I don't know.

          Ok wait this sass thing is kinda lit bc the css updates sooooo fast
          when you upload it to github. I guess it's because of the mapping???
          Not sure how that even works. Either way, I also wanted to test this
          empty tag thing which is lowkey breaking prettier rn. Nvm empty tag
          doesn't work the same as it does in React. I swear like half of
          behance projects are just nice looking books, rotated a bit. Who would
          do something so bland and played out. I kind of want to do a gov ball
          themed styling for this weekend, so I'll just work on it Monday.
          <br />
          Saw half of JPEGMAFIA's set, Skepta, A$AP Ferg, and Jack Harlow.
          Skepta was by far the best since I didn't recognize any of the peggy
          songs that he played. Really sad I couldn't see him perform BALD!
          That's like my favorite track rn. Overall, pretty fun experience.
          Celtics narrowly lost which kinda blew. Got pizza for dinner which was
          pretty good, and then got lost and then ate Taco Bell at like 2 lol.
          Baja blast fucking smacks soooooo hard. Chalupa kinda mid tho.

          <div class="subtitle">
            Gov Ball today was probably more fun than yesterday. Denzel Curry
            set was by far the best one so far. Played all of my favorite songs
            except for VENGEANCE and Zatoichi. Kinda surprised he didn't play
            anything off of that weird project with Kenny Beats. SUMO, ULT,
            Ultimate, and Psycho were sooooo hype. Sebs et al. were actually
            feeling those songs today compared to yesterday where they looked
            dead. Pleasantly surprised he played Black Balloons Reprise, but
            ending with CLOUT COBAIN was a choice. Still Woozy was the first
            thing I saw today and he had fun graphics up and played all his
            popular songs. Joji was so underwhelming. His singing was so mid at
            parts compared to the studio versions. He would yell lyrics and try
            to get hype but man that shit was ass. Slow Dancing in the Dark at
            the end after the shitty bait version was elite. Didn't play his new
            song which is a bummer bc that one's a fucking slapper<br /><br />
            Oh also got all you can eat hot pot after this w/ the boys. So
            fucking good and I'm actually still stuffed writing this like 3.
            hours after. Definitely the most I've eaten in so long. Really don't
            know how I feel about this triangle just chilling in the bottom
            right. Overall I guess this page is like a 7.5/10?

            Today was the longest and most tiring of all 3 days. There was JID,
            100 gecs, Clairo, Glass Animals, J Cole and Carti. JID set was
            definitely the most fun for me since all of us were there and vibing
            hard to the music. He played only bangers and brought Kenny Mason
            out for Stick, which was the most fun of the day if not the whole
            weekend. 100 gecs was lowkey super fun as well just me and Nick
            moshing with random ass people. Clairo set had a shit ton of
            technical difficulties but she was a great singer and I heard all of
            her big songs. Glass Animals would've been super fun but the crowd
            fucking sucked. They played a lot of my favorite songs and song of
            the more hype songs they have. However, the whole crowd kept asking
            for Heat Waves which was obviously going to be the last song of the
            set and would complain after each song bc it wasn't Heat Waves.
            Also, none of these people knew any of the songs so the crowd was
            super dead. Waited in the crowd to get closer for Carti which was a
            fucking mistake. I was so tired at this point and the instant he
            came out I got hit in the head and decided to just leave. Pushing
            past the crowd was like some zombie apocalypse shit though. Took me
            fucking forever to get out and I thought I was going to die. Went to
            J Cole and caught the tail end of the set and heard No Role Modelz
            which was worth ig. In hindsight, I should've just gone to see
            Kaytranada and J Cole instead of waiting for Carti. J Cole also did
            Stick again w/ JID and Kenny Mason and I'm kinda bummed I missed it
            because that's lowkey my favorite song of theirs. <br /><br />
            Got Taco Bell again, lowkey kinda expensive and not like super
            filling, but maybe that's just order diff. Not sure if I will be
            ordering from their establishment again in the future. Watched the
            OTV camping video and that really made me want to find a group of
            ppl to go camping with. Looked so fucking fun.

            Got an offer letter today from Morphic. Did a bit of leetcode after.
            Had the interview with ImmortalFuture which went kinda well. The
            interviewer was lowkey a bot, but the founder seemed chill. I think
            they mentioned it was unpaid, sooooo ya that's a no for me. Also
            their website looks like utter dogshit. The graphics are so fucking
            blurry it's insane. They said they would send a coding challenge
            which I might do just for practice and will ask for feedback, but
            definitely will not be considering the position. Watched some Google
            SWE related videos and saw Alyssa's post and man oh man do I want
            that kinda lifestyle. That shit looks unreasonably comfortable even
            if the work is super shitty. I'm gonna grind my ass off to get that
            internship. I'm already getting sick of the go out to eat meta.
            Kinda want to go back home, focus and just grind out my internship,
            leetcode, and lift. Self-improvement arc resuming after this week of
            leetcode and loitering. <br /><br />
            Went out for dinner with Eleni and Keren. Got some Korean food which
            was like some dumpling and seafood hotpot soup, fried pancake, and
            like some tuna sashimi thing. The soup was sooooo good and filling.
            Went back and watched the Celtics game. Celtics played pretty well
            like q3 and were ass the rest of the game. The offense fell apart
            the fourth quarter. Not sure if they were running as many sets or
            what was going on but the halfcourt offense looked horrendous. No
            ball movement, lots of turnovers just driving into multiple
            defenders, end of shotclock fadeaways. They also couldn't hit a free
            throw for their life. Defense was good, I want to say they were
            playing the PnR with Steph differently but didn't pay too much
            attention. He was just not hitting any shots but Tatum still can't
            score in the second half. <br /><br />
            Made some Shin ramen with the mayo thing kinda. That shit was
            probably better than dinner though I feel like shit after partially
            because I just ate too much. Definitely gaining some weight again,
            and should be cutting down on my portion sizes.
