          I originally started this on Sunday??? but have not touched it until
          today. Not sure if I will be doing this as a daily thing because it is
          kinda time consuming with all the styling and whatnot. Perhaps I can
          automate this in the future where I just submit a title and text and
          then the date related stuff gets autofilled in and then I just have an
          api that gets a random color scheme for a given date and then it
          creates the template. <br />
          In terms of the actual blog, I've been slacking this week and have not
          been working much, mostly just going out to eat and watching anime.
          Much needed break after grinding in the summer, but I guess it has
          been necessary because I need to prep for interviews for next summer.
          Google lifestyle looks so comfortable so I definitely will be sweating
          my ass off to make it. <br />
          Lol this page looks so mid - 6/10

            Celtics won game 3 last night which got me feeling some kind of way.
            I ended up watching the rest of love is war s2 last night. Outside
            of those 2 things I have not done shit since then. Probably just
            doing the crossword and maybe go out later? <br /><br />
            Ended up going out for ramen with Raph and Toshi which was sooooo
            good. Chilled in the park after and lost infinite money on boba
            bets. Also binge watched like half of s3 and ruined my sleep.
            <br /><br />
            Onto Gov Ball tmrw which should be fun. Probably will just use day 1
            template instead since I don't fully understand the box shadowing
            for this page. Credit goes to Lynn Fisher on codepen. Can't link it
            here because of z-index issues so just look it up ig. I should try
            and make this entire site a book to imitate a real journal but that
            would require a lot of js that I don't know.

          Ok wait this sass thing is kinda lit bc the css updates sooooo fast
          when you upload it to github. I guess it's because of the mapping???
          Not sure how that even works. Either way, I also wanted to test this
          empty tag thing which is lowkey breaking prettier rn. Nvm empty tag
          doesn't work the same as it does in React. I swear like half of
          behance projects are just nice looking books, rotated a bit. Who would
          do something so bland and played out. I kind of want to do a gov ball
          themed styling for this weekend, so I'll just work on it Monday.
          <br />
          Saw half of JPEGMAFIA's set, Skepta, A$AP Ferg, and Jack Harlow.
          Skepta was by far the best since I didn't recognize any of the peggy
          songs that he played. Really sad I couldn't see him perform BALD!
          That's like my favorite track rn. Overall, pretty fun experience.
          Celtics narrowly lost which kinda blew. Got pizza for dinner which was
          pretty good, and then got lost and then ate Taco Bell at like 2 lol.
          Baja blast fucking smacks soooooo hard. Chalupa kinda mid tho.

          <div class="subtitle">
            Gov Ball today was probably more fun than yesterday. Denzel Curry
            set was by far the best one so far. Played all of my favorite songs
            except for VENGEANCE and Zatoichi. Kinda surprised he didn't play
            anything off of that weird project with Kenny Beats. SUMO, ULT,
            Ultimate, and Psycho were sooooo hype. Sebs et al. were actually
            feeling those songs today compared to yesterday where they looked
            dead. Pleasantly surprised he played Black Balloons Reprise, but
            ending with CLOUT COBAIN was a choice. Still Woozy was the first
            thing I saw today and he had fun graphics up and played all his
            popular songs. Joji was so underwhelming. His singing was so mid at
            parts compared to the studio versions. He would yell lyrics and try
            to get hype but man that shit was ass. Slow Dancing in the Dark at
            the end after the shitty bait version was elite. Didn't play his new
            song which is a bummer bc that one's a fucking slapper<br /><br />
            Oh also got all you can eat hot pot after this w/ the boys. So
            fucking good and I'm actually still stuffed writing this like 3.
            hours after. Definitely the most I've eaten in so long. Really don't
            know how I feel about this triangle just chilling in the bottom
            right. Overall I guess this page is like a 7.5/10?
