          I originally started this on Sunday??? but have not touched it until
          today. Not sure if I will be doing this as a daily thing because it is
          kinda time consuming with all the styling and whatnot. Perhaps I can
          automate this in the future where I just submit a title and text and
          then the date related stuff gets autofilled in and then I just have an
          api that gets a random color scheme for a given date and then it
          creates the template. <br />
          In terms of the actual blog, I've been slacking this week and have not
          been working much, mostly just going out to eat and watching anime.
          Much needed break after grinding in the summer, but I guess it has
          been necessary because I need to prep for interviews for next summer.
          Google lifestyle looks so comfortable so I definitely will be sweating
          my ass off to make it. <br />
          Lol this page looks so mid - 6/10

            Celtics won game 3 last night which got me feeling some kind of way.
            I ended up watching the rest of love is war s2 last night. Outside
            of those 2 things I have not done shit since then. Probably just
            doing the crossword and maybe go out later? <br /><br />
            Ended up going out for ramen with Raph and Toshi which was sooooo
            good. Chilled in the park after and lost infinite money on boba
            bets. Also binge watched like half of s3 and ruined my sleep.
            <br /><br />
            Onto Gov Ball tmrw which should be fun. Probably will just use day 1
            template instead since I don't fully understand the box shadowing
            for this page. Credit goes to Lynn Fisher on codepen. Can't link it
            here because of z-index issues so just look it up ig. I should try
            and make this entire site a book to imitate a real journal but that
            would require a lot of js that I don't know.
