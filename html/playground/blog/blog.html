          I originally started this on Sunday??? but have not touched it until
          today. Not sure if I will be doing this as a daily thing because it is
          kinda time consuming with all the styling and whatnot. Perhaps I can
          automate this in the future where I just submit a title and text and
          then the date related stuff gets autofilled in and then I just have an
          api that gets a random color scheme for a given date and then it
          creates the template. <br />
          In terms of the actual blog, I've been slacking this week and have not
          been working much, mostly just going out to eat and watching anime.
          Much needed break after grinding in the summer, but I guess it has
          been necessary because I need to prep for interviews for next summer.
          Google lifestyle looks so comfortable so I definitely will be sweating
          my ass off to make it.
