      Messing Around <br />
      Honestly not sure what I am going to be doing with this page, I think I'm
      going to attempt something similar to 75 hard where I put up a new design
      each day though I haven't figured out how to structure this yet.

    <section class="gallery">
      <div class="card">
        <a href="mix-blend/change-color.html">Background aware color</a>
        I spent too much time on this only to learn that it literally takes one
        line off css to accomplish the effect. I thought it would have required
        some sort of opacity and animation but mix-blend does it all.
